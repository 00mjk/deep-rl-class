# Introduction [[introduction]]

In the last unit, we learned about Deep Q-Learning. In this value-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm, we **used a deep neural network to approximate the different Q-values for each possible action at a state.**

Indeed, since the beginning of the course, we only studied value-based methods, **where we estimate a value function as an intermediate step towards finding an optimal policy.**

Because, in value-based, ** \\(π\\) exists only because of the action value estimates, since policy is just a function** (for instance, greedy-policy) that will select the action with the highest value given a state.

But, with policy-based methods, we want to optimize the policy directly **without having an intermediate step of learning a value function.**

So today, **we'll learn about policy-based methods, and we'll study a subset of these methods called Policy Gradients**. Then we'll implement our first policy gradient algorithm called Monte Carlo **Reinforce** from scratch using PyTorch. Before testing its robustness using CartPole-v1, PixelCopter, and Pong.

Let's get started,







Now that we have seen the big picture of Policy-Gradient and its advantages and disadvantages, **let's study and implement one of them**: Reinforce.

## Reinforce (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)

Reinforce, also called Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient, **uses an estimated return from an entire episode to update the policy parameter** \\(\theta\\).


Now that we studied the theory behind Reinforce, **you’re ready to code your Reinforce agent with PyTorch**. And you'll test its robustness using CartPole-v1, PixelCopter, and Pong.

Congrats on finishing this chapter! There was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. You’ve just coded your first Deep Reinforcement Learning agent from scratch using PyTorch and shared it on the Hub 🥳.

It's **normal if you still feel confused** with all these elements. **This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.**

Take time to really grasp the material before continuing.

Don't hesitate to train your agent in other environments. The **best way to learn is to try things on your own!**

We published additional readings in the syllabus if you want to go deeper 👉 **[https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit5/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit5/README.md)**

In the next unit, we’re going to learn about a combination of Policy-Based and value-based methods called Actor Critic Methods.

And don't forget to share with your friends who want to learn 🤗!

Finally, we want **to improve and update the course iteratively with your feedback**. If you have some, please fill this form 👉 **[https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9](https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9)**
