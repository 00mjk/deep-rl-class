# Conclusion


Congrats on finishing this chapter!Â There was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. Youâ€™ve just coded your first Deep Reinforcement Learning agent from scratch using PyTorch and shared it on the Hub ðŸ¥³.

It'sÂ **normal if you still feel confused**Â with all these elements.Â **This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.**

Take time to really grasp the material before continuing.

Don't hesitate to train your agent in other environments. TheÂ **best way to learn is to try things on your own!**

We published additional readings in the syllabus if you want to go deeper ðŸ‘‰Â **[https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit5/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit5/README.md)**

In the next unit, weâ€™re going to learn about a combination of Policy-Based and value-based methods called Actor Critic Methods.

And don't forget to share with your friends who want to learn ðŸ¤—!

Finally, we wantÂ **to improve and update the course iteratively with your feedback**. If you have some, please fill this form ðŸ‘‰Â **[https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9](https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9)**

### **Keep learning, stay awesome ðŸ¤—,**
