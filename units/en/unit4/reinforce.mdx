# Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (Reinforce)



Now that we have seen the big picture of Policy-Gradient and its advantages and disadvantages, **let's study and implement one of them**: Reinforce.

## Reinforce (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)

Reinforce, also called Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient, **uses an estimated return from an entire episode to update the policy parameter** \\(\theta\\).


Now that we studied the theory behind Reinforce, **you’re ready to code your Reinforce agent with PyTorch**. And you'll test its robustness using CartPole-v1, PixelCopter, and Pong.
