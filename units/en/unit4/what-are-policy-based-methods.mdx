# What are the Policy Based methods?

The main goal of Reinforcement learning is to find the optimal policy \\(\pi*\\) that will maximize the expected cumulative reward.
Because Reinforcement Learning is based on the *reward hypothesis* that is **all goals can be described as the maximization of the expected cumulative reward.**

For instance, in a soccer game (that you're going to train the agents in two units), the goal is to win the game. We can describe this goal in reinforcement learning as
maximizing the number of goal scored (when the ball cross the goal line) into your opponent soccer goals. And minimize the number of goals into yours soccer goals.

## Value-based, Policy-based and Actor-Critic methods

We studied in the Unit 1, that we had two methods to find (most of the time approximate) this optimal policy \\(\pi*\\).

- In *Value-Based methods*, we learn a value function.
  - The idea then is that an optimal value function leads to an optimal policy \\(\pi*\\).
  - Our objective is to **minimize the loss between, predicted and target value to match the true action-value function.
  - We have a policy, but it's implicit since it **was generated directly from the Value function**. For instance, in Q-Learning we defined an epsilon-greedy policy.

- On the other hand, in *Policy-based methods*, we directly learn to approximate \\(\pi*\\) without having to learn a value function.
  - The idea then is to parametize policy, for instance using a neural network \\(\pi_\theta\\), this policy will output a probability distribution over actions (stochastic policy).
  - Our objective then is *to maximize the performance of the parametized policy using gradient ascent*.
  - To do that we control the parameter \\(\theta\\) that will affect the distribution of actions over a state.

- Finally, we'll study next time *Actor-Critic* which is a combination of value-based and policy based methods.

Consequently, thanks to Policy-based methods, we can directly optimize our policy \\(\pi_theta\\) to output a probability distribution over actions \\(\pi_\theta(a|s)\\) that leads to the best cumulative return.
To do that we define an objective function \\(J(\theta)\\), that is the expected cumulative reward and we **want to find \\(\theta\\) that maximize this objective function**.

## The difference between Policy-based and Policy-gradient methods

Policy-gradient methods, what we're going to study in this unit, is a subclass of Policy-based methods.
The difference between these two methods **lies on how we optimize the parameter** //(/theta//):

- In *Policy-Based methods*, we search directly for the optimal policy. We can optimize the parameter //(/theta//) **indirectly** by maximize the local approximation of the objective function with techniques like hill climbing, simulated annealing or Evolution Strategies.
- In *Policy-Gradient methods*, because we're a subclass of the Policy-based methods, we search directly for the optimal policy. And we optimize the parameter //(/theta//) **directly** by performing the gradient ascent on the performance of the objective function \\(J(\theta)\\).

In Policy-based methods, the optimization is most of the time *on-policy* since for each update we only use data (trajectories) collected **by our most recent version of** \\(\pi_\theta\\).

Before diving more into how works Policy-gradient methods (the objective function, policy gradient theorem, gradient ascent etc.) let's study the advantages and disadvantages of policy based methods.
