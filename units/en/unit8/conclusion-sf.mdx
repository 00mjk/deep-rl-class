# Conclusion

That's all for today. Congrats on finishing this Unit and the tutorial!

Now that you've successfully trained your Doom agent, why not try deathmatch? We will provide you with some advice in the hands-on. But remember, that's a much more complex level than the one you've just trained. **But it's a nice experiment, and I advise you to try it.**

If you do it, don't hesitate to share your model in the `#rl-i-made-this` channel in our [discord server](https://www.hf.co/join/discord).

See you the last Unit ðŸ”¥,

## Keep Learning, Stay awesome ðŸ¤—
