# Conclusion

That's all for today. Congrats on finishing this Unit and the tutorial!

Now that you've successfully trained your Doom agent, why not try deathmatch? But remember, that's a much more complex level than the one you've just trained. **But it's a nice experiment, and I advise you to try it.**

If you do it, don't hesitate to share your model in the `#rl-i-made-this` channel in our [discord server](https://www.hf.co/join/discord).

This concludes the last unit. But we are not finished yet! ðŸ¤— The following **bonus unit include some of the most interesting, advanced and cutting edge work in Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

See you next time ðŸ”¥,

## Keep Learning, Stay awesome ðŸ¤—
