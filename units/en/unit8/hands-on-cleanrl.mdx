# Hands-on

Now that we studied the theory behind PPO, the best way to understand how it worksÂ **is to implement it from scratch.**

Implementing an architecture from scratch is the best way to understand it, and it's a good habit. We have already done it for a value-based method with Q-Learning and a Policy-based method with Reinforce.

So, to be able to code it, we're going to use two resources:
- A tutorial made by [Costa Huang](https://github.com/vwxyzjn). Costa is behind [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl), a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features.
- In addition to the tutorial, to go deeper, you can read the 13 core implementation details:Â [https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/)

Then, to test its robustness, we're going to train it in 2 different classical environments:

- [Cartpole-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/?highlight=cartpole)
- [LunarLander-v2](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/)

And finally, we will be push the trained model to the Hub to evaluate and visualize your agent playing.

LunarLander-v2 is the first environment you used when you started this course. At that time, you didn't know how it worked, and now, you can code it from scratch and train it.Â **How incredible is that ðŸ¤©.**
