In this second part of Unit 8, we'll get deeper into PPO optimization by using [Sample-Factory](https://samplefactory.dev/), an **asynchronous implementation of the PPO algorithm**, to train our agent playing [vizdoom](https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) (an open source version of Doom).

During the notebook, **you'll train your agent to play Health Gathering level**, where our agent needs to collect health packs to avoid dying. And after that, you'll be able to **train your agent to play more complex versions of the levels, such as Deathmatch**.
