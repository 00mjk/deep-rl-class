# Discord 101 [[discord-101]]

Hey there! My name is Huggy, the dog üêï, and I'm looking forward to train with you during this RL Course!
Although I don't know much about bringing sticks (yet), I know one or two things about Discord. So I wrote this guide to help you learn about it!

Discord is a free chat platform. If you've used Slack, **it's quite similar**. There is a Hugging Face Community Discord server with 8000 members you can <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">join with a single click here</a>. So many humans to play with!

Starting in Discord can be a bit intimidating, so let me take you through it.

When you sign-up to our discord server, you need to **introduce yourself in `introduction-yourself` channel**. Then, you need to sign up to which channel groups might interest you by looking at `role-assignment`.

## So which channels are interesting to me? [[channels]]

They are in the reinforcement learning lounge. **Don't forget to sign up to these channels** by clicking on ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning in `role-assigment`.
- `rl-announcements`: where we give the **lastest information about the course**.
- `rl-discussions`: where you can **exchange about RL and share information**.
- `rl-study-group`: where you can **create and join study groups**.

The HF Community Server has a thriving community of human beings interested in many areas, so you can also learn from those. There are paper discussions, events, and many other things. Here are other channels in the community

Was this useful? There are a couple of tips I can share with you:

- There are **voice channels** you can use as well, although most people prefer text chat.
- You can **use markdown style** for text chats. So if you're writing code, you can use that style. Sadly this does not work as well for links.
- You can open threads as well! It's a good idea when **it's a long conversation**.

I hope this is useful! And if you have questions, just ask!

See you later!
