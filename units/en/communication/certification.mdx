# The certification process


The certification process is **completely free**:

- To get a *certificate of completion*: you need **to pass 80% of the assignments** before the end of April 2023.
- To get a *certificate of honors*: you need **to pass 100% of the assignments** before the end of April 2023.

When we say pass, **we mean that your model must be pushed to the Hub and get a result equal or above the minimal requirement**.

To check your progression and which unit you passed/not passed: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThomasSimonini/Check-my-progress-Deep-RL-Course

Now that you're ready for the certification process, you need to:

1. Go here: [ADD CERTIFICATION SPACE LINK]

2. Type your *hugging face username*, your *first name*, *last name* and the *email* where you want to receive the mail containing the certificate (if you passed).

3. Click on "check if I passed."
  - If you passed 80% of the assignments, **congratulations** you've just got the certificate of completion.
  - If you passed 100% of the assignments, **congratulations** you've just got the honors certificate.
  - If you are below 80%, don't be discouraged. Check which units you need to do again to get your certificate.

Don't hesitate to share your certificate on Twitter (tag me @ThomasSimonini and @huggingface) and on Linkedin.
