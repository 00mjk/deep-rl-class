# Hands-on [[hands-on]]

Now that we studied the Q-Learning algorithm, let's implement it from scratch and train our Q-Learning agent in two environments:
1. [Frozen-Lake-v1  (non-slippery and slippery version)](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) ☃️ : where our agent will need to **go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G)** by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
2. [An autonomous taxi](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/) 🚖 will need **to learn to navigate** a city to **transport its passengers from point A to point B.**

Thanks to a [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard), you'll be able to compare your results with other classmates and exchange the best practices to improve your agent's scores Who will win the challenge for Unit 2?
