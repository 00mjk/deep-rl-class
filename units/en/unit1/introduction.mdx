Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence:Â **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learnsÂ **how to behave**Â in an environmentÂ **by performing actions**Â andÂ **seeing the results.**

So in this first chapter,Â **you'll learn the foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Then, you'll **train your Deep Reinforcement Learning agent, a lunar lander to land correctly on the Moon** using <a href="https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/"> Stable-Baselines3 </a> a Deep Reinforcement Learning library.

And finally, you'll **upload it to the Hugging Face Hub ðŸ¤—, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets, and demos.**

It's essential **to master these elements**Â before diving into implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. The goal of this chapter is to give you solid foundations.

So let's get started! ðŸš€
