And finally, you'll **upload this trained agent to the Hugging Face Hub 🤗, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets, and demos.**

Thanks to our <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard">leaderboard</a>, you'll be able to compare your results with other classmates and exchange the best practices to improve your agent's scores Who will win the challenge for Unit 1 🏆?

So let's get started! 🚀
