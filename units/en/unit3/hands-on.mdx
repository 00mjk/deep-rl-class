# Hands-on [[hands-on]]

Now that you've studied the theory behind Deep Q-Learning, **youâ€™re ready to train your Deep Q-Learning agent to play Atari Games**. We'll start with Space Invaders, but you'll be able to use any Atari game you want ðŸ”¥

We're using the [RL-Baselines-3 Zoo integration](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo), a vanilla version of Deep Q-Learning with no extensions such as Double-DQN, Dueling-DQN, and Prioritized Experience Replay.
