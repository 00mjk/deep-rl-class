# An Introduction to Unity ML-Agents [[introduction-to-ml-agents]]

One of the critical elements in Reinforcement Learning is **to be able to create environments**. An interesting tool to use for that is game engines such as Godot, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

One of them, [Unity](https://unity.com/), created the [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), a plugin based on the game engine Unity that allows us **to use the Unity Game Engine as an environment builder to train agents**.

Unity ML-Agents Toolkit provides a ton of exceptional pre-made environments, from playing football (soccer), learning to walk, and jumping big walls.

In this Unit, we'll learn to use ML-Agents, but **don't worry if you don't know how to use the Unity Game Engine**, you'll don't need to use it to train your agents.

And so, today, we're going to train two agents:
- The first one will learn to **shoot snowballs onto spawning target**.
- The second need to **press a button to spawn a pyramid, then navigate to the pyramid, knock it over, and move to the gold brick at the top**. To do that, it will need to explore its environment, and we will use a technique called curiosity.

Then, after training **, you'll push the trained agents to the Hugging Face Hub**, and you'll be able to **visualize it playing directly on your browser without having to use the Unity Editor**.

Doing this Unit will **prepare you for the next challenge: AI vs. AI where you will train agents in multi-agents environments and compete against your classmates' agents**.

Sounds exciting? Let's get started,
