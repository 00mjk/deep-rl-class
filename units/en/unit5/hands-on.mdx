Now that we learned what is ML-Agents, how it works and that we studied the two environments we're going to use. We're ready to train our agents.

- The first one will learn to **shoot snowballs onto spawning target**.
- The second need to **press a button to spawn a pyramid, then navigate to the pyramid, knock it over, and move to the gold brick at the top**. To do that, it will need to explore its environment, and we will use a technique called curiosity.

After that, you'll be able to watch your agents playing directly on your browser.

The ML-Agents integration on the Hub **is still experimental**, some features will be added in the future. But for now, to validate this hands-on for the certification process, you just need to push your trained models to the Hub.
There's no results to attain to validate this one. But if you want to get nice results you can try to reach:

- For [Pyramids](https://singularite.itch.io/pyramids): Mean Reward = 1.75
- For [SnowballTarget](https://singularite.itch.io/snowballtarget): Mean Reward = 15 or 30 targets shoot in an episode.
