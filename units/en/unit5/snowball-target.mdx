# The SnowballTarget Environment

## The Agent's Goal

The first agent you're going to train is Julien the bear üêª (the name is based after our [CTO Julien Chaumond](https://twitter.com/julien_c)) **to hit targets with snowballs**.

The goal in this environment is that Julien **hits as many targets as possible in the limited time** (1000 timesteps). To do that, it will need **to place itself correctly from the target and shoot**.

In addition, to avoid "snowball spamming" (aka shooting a snowball every timestep), **Julien has a "cool off" system** (it needs to wait 0.5 seconds after a shoot to be able to shoot again).

## The reward function and the reward engineering problem

The reward function is simple. **The environment gives a +1 reward every time the agent's snowball hits a target** and because the agent's goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward, **it will try to hit as many targets as possible**.

We could have a more complex reward function (with a penalty to push the agent to go faster, etc.). But when you design an environment, you need to avoid the *reward engineering problem*, which is having a too complex reward function to force your agent to behave as you want it to do.
Why? Because by doing that, **you might miss interesting strategies that the agent will find with a simpler reward function**.

In terms of code it looks like this:

## The observation space

Regarding observations, we don't use normal vision (frame), but **we use raycasts**.

Think of raycasts as lasers that will detect if it passes through an object.

In this environment our agent have multiple set of raycasts:

In addition to raycasts, the agent gets a "can I shoot" bool as observation.

## The action space

The action space is discrete:
