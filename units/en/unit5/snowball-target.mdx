# The SnowballTarget Environment

## The Agent's Goal
The first agent you're going to train is Julien the bear (the name is based after our [CTO Julien Chaumond](https://twitter.com/julien_c)) to hit targets with snowballs.

The goal in this environment is that Julien the bear **hit as much as possible targets that spawned, in the limited time** (1000 timesteps). To do that, it will need **to place itself correctly from the target and shoot
**. In addition, to avoid "snowball spamming" (aka shooting a snowall every timestep),**Julien the bear has a "cool off" system** (it needs to wait 0.5 seconds after a shoot to be able to shoot again).

## The observation space

In terms of observations, we donâ€™t use normal vision (frame), but we use TOOD ADD raycasts that can each detect objects (target, walls)

Think of raycasts as lasers that will detect if it passes through an object.
